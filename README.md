# Labor n Delivery Tracker
Just a simple app I made for my wife to anonymously track how many babies she has birthed, and details about each birth.

Has a stats page where she can see where they are.

## Why Expo? (Retrospective?)
No ones going to read this besides myself but...

I decided to use Expo because it was recommended a bunch of places. While it is fairly easy to use, it seems to be very opinionated, and almost over simplified.
I'm not sure I would choose Expo again for another mobile application. I have enjoyed used Tauri recently for projects, or even just writing in native Swift code would be more enjoyable.
