DESIGNED FOR L&D NURSES
Built specifically for labor and delivery professionals who want to honor every birth they attend. Whether you work day shift, night shift, or rotating schedules, MiracleMeter adapts to your workflow.

KEY FEATURES:
- Quick birth logging with one tap
- Track delivery types (vaginal, c-section)
- Gender and multiple birth tracking
- Weekly goals that fit shift work
- Streak shields for busy weeks
- Recovery challenges to restore streaks
- Milestone celebrations (1 month, 3 months, 1 year+)
- Beautiful shareable stats cards
- Achievement badges for career milestones
- Annual year-in-review recap
- Dark mode support
- Widget for quick logging

CELEBRATE YOUR CAREER
Unlock achievements as you reach delivery milestones. Share your stats with colleagues. See your annual recap of every baby you've welcomed into the world.
