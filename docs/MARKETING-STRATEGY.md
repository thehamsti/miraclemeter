## 1. App Store Optimization (ASO)

### Key 2025-2026 Algorithm Changes

**MAJOR UPDATE (June 2025):** Apple now reads text from screenshot captions as keyword metadata. This is a game-changer for ASO.

**Action Items:**
- Add high-contrast text overlays to screenshots with keywords
- Use benefit-focused copy (not "Easy to Use" but "Track Births Fast")
- Reinforce title/subtitle keywords + add long-tail variations

### Keyword Strategy

**Ranking Weight Hierarchy:**
1. **App Title** (30 chars): Highest weight
2. **Subtitle** (30 chars): Second strongest
3. **Keywords Field** (100 chars): Third priority
4. **Screenshot Captions**: NEW - contributes to rankings

**Target Keywords:**
- Primary: `labor delivery nurse`, `birth tracker`, `baby counter`
- Secondary: `L&D nurse app`, `delivery tracker`, `contraction timer`
- Long-tail: `nurse shift app`, `birth log for nurses`

### Screenshots & Preview Videos

**Best Practices:**
- First 3 screenshots determine 70%+ of conversion decisions
- Show app in action on real device frames
- Text overlays with benefit-focused copy
- Use 8-10 screenshots max (quality over quantity)
- Include social proof: "Used by 1000+ L&D Nurses"

**Preview Video (30 seconds max):**
- First 3 seconds: Hook with core value prop
- Show 2-3 key features with finger taps visible
- End with clear CTA and app icon
- No sound required - use captions

### Ratings & Reviews

**2026 Benchmarks:**
- 4.4+ stars = competitive threshold
- 4.0-4.3 = penalty risk in rankings
- Review velocity (new reviews/week) signals active user base

**Triggers Implemented:**
- After streak milestone celebrations (4+ weeks)
- After 3rd achievement unlock
- After viewing annual recap

## 2. Apple Search Ads

### Campaign Structure (4-Tier System)

| Campaign | Match Type | Bid Strategy | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Brand** | Exact | Aggressive ($2-5 CPT) | Protect brand terms |
| **Category** | Exact | Moderate ($1.50-3 CPT) | "birth tracker," "L&D nurse app" |
| **Competitor** | Exact | Moderate-high ($2-4 CPT) | Competitor app names |
| **Discovery** | Broad | Conservative ($0.75-1.50 CPT) | Find new keywords |

### Budget Allocation

**Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Testing - $3,000-4,000/month**
- Brand: $500/mo
- Category: $1,500/mo
- Competitor: $1,000/mo
- Discovery: $1,000/mo

**Phase 2 (Month 3+): Scaling**
- Double budget on campaigns with <$3 CPI and >10% conversion rate
- Separate US from international (UK, Canada, Australia as Tier 1)

### Optimization Rules

- TTR (Tap-Through Rate) >5% = increase bid 20%
- Conversion rate >15% = increase bid 30%
- CPI >$5 after 2 weeks = pause or lower bid 40%
- Add exact-match winners from Discovery as negatives to prevent self-competition

2. CPP #1: "contraction timer" keyword - emphasize timing features
3. CPP #2: "birth tracker nurse" keyword - focus on streak/stats
4. CPP #3: "nurse shift app" keyword - highlight shift pattern integration
